    <h1>Matzoh Lasagna</h1>

    <img src="../images/MatzohLasagna.jpg" alt="Matzoh Lasagna" height="50%" width="50%">

    <p>
        A traditional meat lasagna made with matzoh instead of lasagna noodles. Very tasty, and great for Chosen People
        who don't keep kosher but who do keep Passover kosher.
    </p>

    <p>
        For baking, you will want a deep square oven-safe baking dish about the size of 1 sheet of matzoh (about 8.5"x8.5").
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb. ground meat of your choice (suggestions: beef&pork mix, turkey)</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp. olive oil</li>
        <li>1 & 1/4 tsp. kosher salt</li>
        <li>3/8 tsp. black pepper</li>
        <li>2.5 cups marinara-based pasta sauce (I suggest something like tomato&basil or roasted garlic)</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp. Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>16oz. whole milk ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>3/4 cup shredded parmesean cheese</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1.5 cups shredded mozarella cheese</li>
        <li>3 sheets matzoh</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Pre-heat oven to 375 degrees fahrenheit. Heat olive oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add ground
            meat, 1 Tbsp. salt, and 1/4 tsp. pepper, and cook until browned. Add pasta sauce, reduce heat to low, and
            simmer for 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            While meat & sauce are simmering, in a large mixing bowl combine the italian seasoning, ricotta, egg, half 
            of the parmesean cheese, and the remaining salt and pepper. Stir until well combined.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a medium mixing bowl, combine mozarella and remaining parmesean. Mix together until well combined.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add 1/3rd of meat sauce to baking dish, then place one sheet of matzoh above and gently press down - firmly
            enough that sauce will slightly soak through holes in matzoh but not hard enough to break the sheet of matzoh.
            Add 1/3rd of ricotta mixture above matzoh and spread evenly across the sheet of matzoh, covering the baking
            dish to its sides. Sprinkle 1/3rd of the mozarella/parmesean mixture evenly above the ricotta. Add 2 more
            layers to this dish in the same order - meat sauce, then matzoh, then ricotta, then cheese.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cover the lasagna with aluminum foil, and place in the oven on a rack in the middle. Bake for 50 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            After 50 minutes, remove the foil from the top of the lasagna. Cook for an additional 10 minutes in the oven,
            or until cheese on top is browned.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove lasagna from the oven and let it rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing and serving.
        </li>
    </ol>
